## Guillaume Bouffard

A French and fun London-based coding MacGyver, who has a passion for solving puzzles, maths problems and challenges that involve a deep level of concentration. Despite having received multiple awards, I felt for a long-time that I wasn't true to myself in my previous career. In March 2015, I took a leap of faith and put my trust in the Makers Academy cursus to do what I wanted to do for a very long time: learn how to code. 

Having recently graduated, I am now looking to join for the long-term a business that I can add value to and learn from, at the same time as I can enjoy my new career with a team of smart and fun people.

### Additional Coding Skills:

- **Agile methodology**: I follow its principle and start by building a MVP for every project; the same applies for any additional features: they are only added one-step-at-a-time.

- **TDD addiction**: I do not write single line of code before I have drawn on paper a diagram and written in English the behaviors that I expect classes/models to have (or not to have). Only once I'm happy with the design and tests, I start coding.

- **Proactive and autonomous learning**: learning is a lifelong process. I want to keep it at, whether I'm employed or not. A the moment, I'm focussed on cementing my knowledge around Javascript and Ruby, but once I will feel that I have gone as far as I can go on my own, I intend to look at other languages such as Java, Swift and Python.

- **Teamwork and pair-programming**: I find it pretty easy to get along with other coders and the software development community. It's as if we're all born with an extra cool gene. I especially like solving problems as a team: it's a great feeling to share and also the occasion to high-five everyone in the team when it happens :)

- **Debugging & problem solving**: I have learnt how to debug in JavaScript and in ruby as well as improve my Google search and StackOverflow skills.

- **Meeting deadlines and work under pressure**: I was already doing these my previous jobs and nothing has changed as a coder. At Makers Academy, we had coding challenges every week; I never missed a single submission deadline.

- **Well-written code**: I try to keep my code as clean as possible; I refactor, indent, follow style guides and respect the DRY and YAGNI rules. I'm aware that a clean code will make life easier for my future teammates; it will also be a good thing for my own reputation within the coding community.

- **Creativity**: I'm known by many for being very creative; I often come up with cool, revenue generating, client retention and engagement ideas. The final team project that I worked on, at makers Academy was actually one of my pitched ideas. I will come up with realistic suggestions to discuss with the team for RFP or bids phases, hopefully to win these bids or impress potential clients.

- **Fun and good sence of humour**: I'm said to be pretty fun to be around. I think that it's very important and it's so much easier to work with someone who's fun and entertaining; not as important as smart and efficient but still a great bonus.
